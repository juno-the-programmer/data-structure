# When to Use ?

Problems on which greedy approach work has two properties:
1. Greedy - choice property:
   A global optimum can be arrived at by selecting a local optimum.
2. Optimal Substructure 
   An optimal solution to the problem contains an optimal solution to subproblems

## Applications
1. Activity Selection Problem
2. Huffman Coding
3. Job Sequencing Problem
4. Fractional Knapsack Problem
5. Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree
